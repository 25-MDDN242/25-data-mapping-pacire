# MDDN 242 2025 Project 3: Data Mapping

For this project I have decided to do a warped gird for my different types of glass that I own at home. I got three different types of glass I own and started off manually masking my first three glass for the traing data. Then for the testing data I took pictures of the same three glass' but in different angles for the ai processing. After my test images were processed after testing the entire code through the sketch.js and the result I got it masked and render pretty well as the glass were clearly shown to be the masked output. I then tryed out the 3Layers.js code which rendered out my images pretty well aswell. I then incoporated the warp into the image and it rendered out better than expected with the output rendering out the background to a exact same of the input and the mask is warped with a offset of 20.

The reason I decided to keep the idea of the warped glass for my output is because I wanted to display a real world image whilst showing a abnormality to the image so I decided on the warping of the glass to show an anomaly to a near realistic photo. If I could improve on what this project further I would maybe change the colors of the warp to display more abnomality towards the piece.
